# Retail Sales Analysis and Dynamic Pricing Model

## Description
This project analyzes retail sales data to explore pricing strategies and their impact on sales. The analysis includes data visualization, calculation of price elasticity, and implementation of dynamic pricing rules to optimize revenue.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python installed (preferably version 3.7 or higher).
2. Install the necessary packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
    ```
3. If using Google Colab, upload the retail sales dataset when prompted.

## Usage
1. Upload the `retail_sales_dataset.csv` file.
2. Run the provided script to:
    - Load and inspect the dataset.
    - Visualize data distributions.
    - Analyze price elasticity and dynamic pricing impact.
3. The script will output:
    - Various plots illustrating sales data insights.
    - Comparison summary of sales under existing and dynamic pricing.

## Features
- **Data Visualization**: Histograms and scatter plots to understand sales trends.
- **Elasticity Calculation**: Determines price elasticity of demand over time.
- **Dynamic Pricing Simulation**: Implements pricing rules based on product segments.

## Code Overview
- Importing necessary libraries.
- Reading and displaying the dataset.
- Plotting distributions and scatter plots for insights.
- Calculating price elasticity.
- Defining price brackets and segments.
- Applying dynamic pricing rules and comparing sales results.
